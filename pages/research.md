# Research
As people and companies go about their business, they are leaving a treasure trove of data about the real economy--down at its most basic unitâ€”-on the servers of payment processing institutions worldwide. We can make sense of this data through the lens of monetary flows. Individual transactions come together to create network structure in the flow of money through the economy as a whole. How, exactly, this happens is a compelling question worthy of both empirical and theoretical study.

### [Computational Network Science Lab](https://www.computationalnetworkscience.org/)

Together with dr. Frank Takes and several MSc students, I am advancing projects in mapping and modeling the network structure of the Dutch economy. We are in collaboration with the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, Statistics Netherlands, and the Institute for Advance Study at the University of Amsterdam.

### [Lazer Lab](https://lazerlab.net/)

I have contributed to several research projects in the Lazer Lab that advance methods in computational social science. These projects aim to make digital trace and administrative data more useful to researchers.

### Consulting
Alongside its promise for basic research in economics, transaction data from payment systems holds useful provider-specific insights. I have worked extensively with collaborators outside academia to apply this technology towards understanding real-world mobile money payment systems in developing countries: Microfinance Opportunities, International Finance Corporation, Telenor Research, and Cignifi Inc. The data transformation process developed as a part of my dissertation produced is patent-pending for Northeastern University.
