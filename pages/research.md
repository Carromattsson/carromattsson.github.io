# Research
As persons and corporations go about their business, they are leaving a treasure trove of data about the real economy—down at its most basic unit—on the servers of payment processing institutions worldwide. I have developed the network science we need to make sense of this data through the lens of monetary flows. My approach makes such flows amenable to empirical research down to the level of granularity at which persons and corporations actually transact. These individual economic actions come together, via the movement of money, to create structure in the economy at larger scales. How, exactly, this happens is a compelling question worthy of both empirical and theoretical study.

### Consulting
Alongside its promise for basic research in economics, transaction data from payment systems holds useful provider-specific insights. The data transformation process that I developed during my PhD has produced a provisional patent for Northeastern University, and I have worked extensively with collaborators outside academia to apply this technology towards understanding real-world mobile money payment systems in developing countries.

I have contributed to several research projects in the Lazer Lab that advance methods in computational social science. These projects aim to make digital trace and administrative data more useful to researchers.
