# Leadership

There is a budding research community at the intersection between network science and complexity economics. I believe there is tremendous scientific promise in this space, and that we can accelerate the growth of this community by inviting others to join in the fun.

### [Workshop on Economic and Financial Networks](https://sites.google.com/view/fineconets-netscix2020)
As a satellite of NetSci-X 2020 in Tokyo, Japan this workshop will benefit from both the rich interdisciplinary community in Network Science and from Japan's status as a nexus for research in economic and financial networks. The workshop aims to bring together researchers active in this area from across disciplines and areas of the world to discuss state-of-the-art work, share practical knowledge, and create opportunities for novel and fruitful collaborations.

### [INET YSI Complexity Economics Working Group](https://ysd.ineteconomics.org/workinggroup/complexity-economics)
Economies and societies are complex and evolving systems. The Complexity Economics Working Group provides a platform for students and early stage researchers to learn and discuss methodology and insights from complexity economics and related fields.

### [Society for Young Network Scientists](https://twitter.com/official_SYNS)
SYNS is a society of young network scientists, whether by age or experience. If you're an undergrad, master's, PhD, postdoc, or just a researcher new to Network Science, join us. You belong here.
