# Hello!

I am Network Scientist developing the network science we need to understand economies as complex systems. Currently a Postdoc with the Computational Network Science Lab within LIACS at Leiden University, where I study real-world production networks, financial transaction networks, and supply chains. One day I'll be able to tell you where, exactly, your money goes. 

In May, 2020 I became one of the first to graduate from the innovative PhD program out of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University. My dissertation delves into the most minute details of mobile money payment systems and builds up a broadly applicable way to analyze large-scale transaction data. It turns out that the movement of money can be a *fascinating* perspective to take on Economics.     

*I expect to return to the Economics job market in 2022 -- need some Data Science in your department?*
