# Hello!

I am Network Scientist developing the network analysis tools and modeling frameworks we need to study the economy as a complex system. Currently a Postdoc with the Computational Network Science group within LIACS at Leiden University, where I study real-world production networks, financial transaction networks, and temporal network representations. Before this, I have been a member of the Lazer Lab advancing methods in computational social science and an NSF INTERN with Microfinance Opportunities incorporating network science into financial diaries methodologies.

In May, 2020 I became one of the first to graduate from the innovative Network Science PhD program out of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University. My dissertation introduces a network analysis approach for large-scale transaction data and maps the movement of e-money through mobile money payment systems. It turns out that "following the money" through networks can be a *fascinating* perspective to take on Economics.

*I expect to return to the Economics job market in 2022 -- need some Network/Data/Computational Social Science in your department?*
